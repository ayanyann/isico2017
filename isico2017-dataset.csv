One of the stages in planning software development projects is to estimate the effort and cost. The good news is, there are already
studies related to the estimated cost of software development projects whose results are close to the real cost. In this study, we
compared two cost estimation methods which have quite small deviations, such Use Case Points - Activity Based Costing models
(then namely UCPabc) and Function Points (FP). Some aspects that were compared are process and parameters, complexity factors,
and deviation. The results of this research are, first, the difference of process algorithm and parameters. Secondly, there were
differences in complexity factors, 21 factors on UCPabc model and 14 factors on FP method. So, the deviation between two
methods of effort estimation toward actual effort was 11.9 percent using UCPabc and 27.8 percent using FP. Therefore, the UCPabc
method is the closest method of effort estimation toward actual effort.

Lately, the stages of planning software development projects have begun to consider the scientific side. As an intangible outcome,
the budgeting must also be done in a transparent and accountable manner. The authors use Function Points (FP) method approach
on the basis of 4 main reasons for estimating the effort and cost of software development (4 public service applications as research
object). In this study, there are two core phases, first, elaborating complexity factors based on other method references (i.e Use
Case Points) and mapping of non-functional requirements on Term of Reference. Furthermore, the second phase is to calculate and
compare the estimated effort and cost if the original FP method before and after modified on the complexity factor. We conclude
there is a difference of 7.19 percent (equivalent to IDR 13,567,631) between FP method calculations using and not using modified
complexity adjustment factors.

Nowadays, software effort and time estimation becomes a substantial factor in software engineering community. Accurate
estimation can enhances performance in managing the project schedule, human resource allocation, cost estimation, etc.
Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) II is commonly used model of software estimation influenced by four coefficients. The
optimal coeffiecients will produce optimal model in estimating effort and time development. To overcome that problem, this
paper proposed a hybrid model of cuckoo search and harmony search algorithm for optimizing four coefficients of COCOMO-II
to get optimal estimation. The proposed approach is applied on NASA 93 dataset and evaluated by using Magnitude of Relative
Error (MRE) and Magnitude of Relative Error (MMRE). Experimental results show that the proposed method is more effective in
estimating effort and time development of the software project than COCOMO-II and cuckoo search algorithm.",COCOMO II Model; Effort Estimation; Time Development Estimation; Cuckoo Search; Harmony Search; Hybrid Optimization Parameter

Knowledge management adoption in the supply chain (SC) is at its infancy and related scholarly research is relatively scarce. The
main difficulties are in figuring out how to combine knowledge management concepts with the SC development process, to
improve the overall steps, performance and productivity of the SC. The purpose of this paper is to test and analyse the existing
knowledge based SCs frameworks in the literature (including manufacturing, service and software SCs), and verify how they
integrate with the knowledge management concepts, taking into consideration some parameters including lessons learned, etc.
which we believe, hinder such knowledge process in the existing frameworks. To come up with the proposed framework, we
conducted an extensive research on the existing frameworks to identify how they handle and transfer knowledge during the
development process of the SC and how they integrate the knowledge management concepts with their frameworks. Few SC
frameworks were tested to figure out their efficiency and effectiveness. Finally, after detailed comparative analysis and testing,
the research suggests that the proposed framework adds value to existing research and could be adopted by SC participants as a
useful knowledge based framework which could increase the SC overall speed, performance and productivity. The proposed
framework consists of parameters which should be introduced for more effective SSSC operations, while the absence of major
parameters (identified in this paper) makes a framework less efficient.

","
The webometric ranking system is currently one of the most widely used methods to rank website quality including for university
websites. It uses pre-determined weights for the criteria assessed in these method; therefore, raised a question whether the pre-
determined weigh is objective. Entropy method provides a more objective weighing method criterion. This study aims to
compare the use of the entropy method followed by PROMETHEE II methods to evaluate 27 Indonesian university websites.
The entropy method assesses four indicators: visibility, presence, openness and excellence of the website performance. The
PROMETHEE II method was conducted to provide a complete ranking of university websites from the best to the worst, based
on a pair-wise comparison of alternatives along each recognized criterion. The entropy method resulted in 0,3; 0,17:0,23; and
0,27 for visibility, presence, openness and excellence weights, respectively. The website ranking using PROMETHEE II method
was not significantly different from the ranking generated from the webometric ranking system. To conclude, the use of entropy
as a more objective method followed by PROMETHEE II is a reasonable alternative of the webometric system for ranking
university websites, at least in the Indonesian context.

Tree Structure visualization techniques are one of the important techniques to support the analysis of large hierarchical structure
data. They are typically used as tree structure node-link diagram. However, it is difficult to visualize the content of directories
when there are too many child nodes. In this paper, a study on the effectiveness of the tree-maps as tree structure visualization
will be presented. Tree-maps are always considered as one of the interesting topic of research in HCI. Therefore, in this paper we
will discuss about applying various types of Tree-maps as one of the visualization techniques. First, we will look into current
problem faced by Tree structured node-link diagram. We will also look into four main types of tree-maps such as original tree-
maps, Circular Tree-maps, Cushion Tree-maps and 3D Tree-maps. Finally, the effectiveness of these tree-maps to visualize the

Traffic congestion is a problem that becomes government concem in many big cities like Surabaya. Some initiatives have been
carried out by the government to decrease the intensity of traffic congestion, ranging from various policy like special lane for
motorcycle, odd ??? even license plate, etc. However, it is yet to be successful to decrease the heavy traffic in many big cities in
Indonesia. The right solution tends to encourage people to use public transport instead of private cars. Within the framework of
Intelligent Transport System, this paper proposes an advanced traveller information system with itinerary optimisation by
Angkot, a common public transport mode in Indonesia. The itinerary optimisation is modelled as an orienteering problem and is
solved using iterative local search ??? hill climbing algorithm. The experiment results show that generally the proposed algorithm
could solve the problem fast and effectively. In addition to propose the initial algorithm, the main contribution of this paper is a
new dataset for orienteering problem that may encourage researcher to come up with more sophisticated algorithm. Eventually,
the proposed system could encourage more people to use public transport.

The design and development of software agents that perform adjustable autonomous actions in dynamic environments is a
challenging research issue. Adjustable autonomous agents operate according to a spectrum of autonomy states. The autonomy
states are dynamically adjusted to improve the agents??? performance and avoid autonomy surprises. For instance, the agents need to
be guided or improvise when they encounter unplanned events. In this paper, we propose an Adjustable Autonomy Management
(AAM) module for multi-agent systems. We integrate the AAM module within a BDI agent???s architecture to form an adjustable
autonomous agent. The AAM module enables the agent to internally adjust its autonomy and handles external autonomy
adjustments. We apply the agents in an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system. We test the UAV in a dynamic
environment via experimenting acrial surveillance missions. The test results show that the agent-based UAV system successfully
operates in the dynamic environment and performs the aerial surveillance missions. Subsequently, the AAM module is able to
manage agents??? autonomy, reduce human workload and reduce adjustable autonomy disturbance.

VANET (Vehicular Ad-hoc Network) is an intelligent network technology in wireless communication where the vehicles act as
mobile nodes to share data without any central access point for a safety issue. The vehicles send some information about road
status and traffic. Due to recent growth of software technology, it becomes necessary to make a step toward using software to
check on this network before the implementation. Simulation tools give us a comprehensive study of the network before applying
it in a real environment. There are many network simulators which has their own features to distinguish it from other. We should
focus on choosing the best one that gives the best results. NS2 is the most common simulator tool, in this project we used NS2 to
design the network, which made communication within the network with different routing protocols. We compare many different
routing protocols (AODV, AOMDV, DSDV and DSR) based on the various common metrics, throughput, end to end delay, and
packet delivery ratio by varying the number of mobile vehicles while applying CBR traffic. The comparison has been done by
using simulation tool NS2. To build the network scenario more like a real environment, different mobility models will be
considered. Two type of mobility patterns were used in our project. Studying about different routing protocols give us an idea of
using the best protocol in different cases under various parameters of a network. We wrote a TCL Script on NS2 to evaluate the
behavior of routing protocols that used in VANET network. After executing the simulation in different mobility models, we
realized that AODV has the best performance at both and preferable for the large and small environment of network, but it

Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) is utilized to increase oil production after primary and secondary methods. EOR is classified into
three main categories i.e. thermal recovery, chemical flooding and miscible flooding. Alkaline Surfactant Polymer (ASP) EOR is
a method of chemical flooding in which the increase of oil recovery is ranging from 19% to 34% of original oil in place (OOIP).
In order to obtain optimal results of ASP EOR needs to consider several parameters i.e. the concentration of ASP, ASP material
procurement costs, the injection pressure and mass flow rate of injection. Beggs-Brill method is used to model the pressure drop in
the injection well and production well. The mean error of Beggs-Brill method to PIPESIM simulation result is 0.5076%. Meanwhile
the modelling of reservoir pressure conducted using Darcy equation shows that the mean error of Darcy equation model to

Motive is an important underlying reason an organization engages in a particular behavior, which includes initiating a particular
information systems adoption. Adoption motives, however, are situational, urging motivational studies to be contingent on the
context. The purposes of this paper are therefore twofold: (1) reflecting on the case of Indonesian e-voting initiative, to examine
the local government???s motives behind e-government adoption; (2) to identify emerging themes that might have influenced the
process of e-voting adoption in several Indonesian villages. Qualitative data were collected from five government leaders at both
municipal and village levels in a municipality that have previously conducted village e-voting elections. This study found that
performance-related rationalities, i.c. cost-savings, reducing service delivery-time, are the main drives for e-voting adoption in this
case. Although instances of motives belonging to technological and strategic clusters have also been recorded, none of the leaders
responded to operation-related motives. This might be due to the simplistic interpretation of e-voting as merely a replacement for
paper-ballots, while its broader implication to democratic values and election best practices have been largely ignored. Moreover,
it was evident from the study that the decision to adopt voting technology in this case has been significantly influenced by political
interests, where strong cases of leadership further accelerated the adoption process. The strong determination exhibited by higher
level leaders has put significant pressures on the lower level authorities to implement e-voting, which might have conflicted with
their own organizational strategy, socio-cultural norms, and citizen preparedness. This study is important to identify context-based
rationales behind e-voting initiatives in Indonesia and the results are relevant to assist Indonesian government in the development
of other e-government strategy in the future. This paper further emphasizes for a broader strategy which takes account of the risks

readiness for such a system. A structured literature review was done in accord with the PRISMA guidelines. The barriers
identified were categorized into the information systems resources. The review suggests that people resource (user resistance and
lack of skills) and procedure resource (concern for return on investment and lack of administrative and policy support) are the
primary barriers to overcome. Further studies are directed to examine the barriers in detail and recognize how to address said

This paper describes the application of a community detection algorithm, namely LinkRank algorithm, on a citation network.
Community detection is a task in network analysis which aims to find sets of tightly connected nodes that are loosely connected with
other nodes outside of those sets. In our study, we focused on a citation network which depicts relationships between cited papers
and the papers which cite those papers. The objectives of our study are to identify communities of papers based on the citation
relationships and analyze the similarities of topics within each community. The approach of our study to reach the objectives
is by applying LinkRank algorithm to a citation network. LinkRank algorithm is chosen because it can be applied to a directed
network where other algorithms that we have surveyed can only be used on undirected network. The citation network that we used
in our study is from Aminer website. In applying the algorithm, we had to port the original source code which is written in C
programming language into Python programming language for our convenience in doing the experiment. The result shows that the
algorithm able to detect 10,442 communities from 188,514 nodes. Once the communities have been detected, we sampled top three
communities (the ones with the largest number of members) and took the top 10 nodes with the highest PageRank score in each of
those communities. The samples show that most of the nodes have similar topic, but there are still some nodes with different topics
mixed inside the same community. We found the ratio between nodes with similar and different topics to be 7 to 3, that is 70% of
the nodes have similar topic while the other 30% have different topics. Thus, the homophily of each community does not reach
100%. Nevertheless, our study confirms that LinkRank algorithm can be used for community detection on directed network.

With increasing numbers and complexity of processes stored in the event log on a system, a solution to analyze these processes
more easily is a formation of the process model. There are algorithms of process discovery that offered ways to formed process
models based on data in the event logs. During the forming of process models, several problems arise, such as detecting non-free
choice and invisible prime tasks. This research offers a method that utilizes Coupled Hidden Markov Model to modeling processes
with non-free choice and invisible prime tasks in incomplete event log. This method was compared with Alpha$ algorithm to
evaluate the quality of the method. The evaluation proves that the method of this research can depict process model containing
non-free choice and invisible prime tasks. This output of the evaluation also indicates that a process model produced by the method
with dealy Coupled Hidden Markov Model has higher fitness and precision than the model produced by Alpha$ algorithm.

Cost Construction Model (COCOMO) is an algorithmic software development cost estimation model, which requires accurate
input values for each attribute. Input misjudgment on an attribute will have a great impact on the estimated effort. One of the
attributes in COCOMO II is product complexity. Currently, the level of product complexity is assessed subjectively by an expert.
This approach tends to be inaccurate because it is influenced by emotions, opinions and experiences. This paper proposes
Cyclometer, a new approach based on the cyclomatic complexity metric to measure the product complexity level objectively. A
comparison study was carried out and showed that the results comply with the expert judgments as indicated by moderate kappa

Medicine can be ordered when distributors assign some of its salesman for visiting pharmacies or hospitals and offer medicine to
be sold. Pharmacies who will order must create a letter and handed it to the salesman. All orders from some pharmacies or hospitals
will be entered into the order book manually by the salesman. Afterwards, order book returned to distributor and after going

In news domain, sentiments captured in the form of sentiment labels (emoticon) give a quick feedback of reactions towards the
contents of the news. As these reactions are valuable indicators for social and political well beings, we are motivated to automate
the classification of news texts based on these indicators, e.g. happy, sad, angry, amused etc. Unlike other review texts that contain
more explicit words which can be interpreted directly for sentiment classification, news texts mostly report facts and figures. This
resulted in needs to identify whether contents of news can be exploited for classification or otherwise. Hence, in this work, a study
is conducted to analyze and determine the relevant key parts of news contents that can be to be used for sentiment-based
classification. Two criteria, i.e. text Part of Speech and text position, which could possible influence the training of the classifier
are studied. Evaluations are conducted on the collection of 250 English news texts labelled with sentiments from sentiment voting
system. The results for sentiment-based category has recorded F score of 0.422 whereas for polarity-based category has recorded
F score of 0.837. The study has shown that when finer categories (e.g. happy, sad etc.) are used, the inspected criteria are less

cycle time reduction. The process mining results show that some of the activities are very uncontrolled i.e. sometimes it can be
done in a short time but in other cases it took a long time. The activity can be done quickly because the procedure is bypassed.
The bottlenecks occur due to technical issues (error in the systems), data migration issues (the introduction of new material

This research examines the motivational factors which affect knowledge sharing among university students during the use of
pedagogical discussion cases in/out of the classroom. The research identifies three factors, namely the individual level (student???s
prior knowledge, experience and self-efficacy), the lecturer level (lecturer???s prior knowledge, experience and characteristics of
trust and fairness), and the environmental level (course context and diversity in team structure). The research was conducted on
undergraduate business students enrolled in one of the business management courses (n = 103) and analyzed using multiple
regression, a questionnaire was administered to the students and data analysis was conducted. The results of the analysis
demonstrated that the student???s prior knowledge and experience, the lecturer???s prior knowledge and experience, and the course
context positively influenced the level of knowledge sharing. In addition, the analysis demonstrated that the student???s self-
efficacy, the lecturer???s characteristics, and the diversity in team structure have no significant influence on knowledge sharing.
The implication of the study is that lecturers need to promote the students the importance of knowledge sharing as well as
understanding their subject and cultivate a positive course context and learning environment to encourage knowledge sharing
among the students.

Abstract

This paper adopted regression approach with Least Square and Natural Logarithmic transformation in response variables to predict
the number of Dengue fever attacks in Malang Regency, Indonesia. The prediction involved weather factors. 8 models were
prepared, and it was found that the weather factor was the most influential. Some tests, including hypothesis test, were adopted to
identify the significance of the model found. The model using response variable with logarithmic natural transformation resulted
better model compared to the ones without transformation. It was also supported by the average MAPE of the model that was less
than 10%. Therefore, it was identified that the regression approach will work well if both dependent and independent variables
have relatively similar variances so that the variability of the dependent variables can be well explained by the independent variable.

Software system development has been beset by consistency problem since its infancy. This problem is still greater during the
software design stage, and are greater still in UML diagrams. This is principally caused because of the existence of multiple
views among UML diagrams. The main issue that arise when assessing the similarity of UML diagrams from multiple views is
how consistency can be maintained across different views during the comparison. Previous works have failed to address this
issue. They only compare one type of diagram in one stage and another type of diagram in another stage, this manner of
similarity assessment lead to incorrect similarity scores, thereby creating inconsistencies in the information conveyed by the
UML artifacts during software reuse. This paper presents Multiview similarity assessment technique, in which the similarity of
UML diagrams is computed from structural and behavioral views of software systems.

Data has been become increasingly and abundantly available as industries have applied numerous information systems to automate
business process execution. Process mining focuses on discovering knowledge from historical data repositories to support better
decision making, mostly from a single perspective. Multi-perspective, or multi-dimensional process mining becomes an open issue
in process mining working groups, since the nature of event logs vary according to its domain, and a single process model might
not be justified. Notwithstanding the previous work and the multi-dimensional process mining approaches developed therein, the
contents of iterative indexing method and platform-dependent computational issues cause problems on scalability and usability
respecting real world implementation. In response to such problems, the present study formulated a scalable indexing algorithm
for multi-dimensional process analysis with distributed computing. A new solution is applied wherein we index only attributes
inside the selected events and show only a reduced graph of long-duration gaps between events. The implementation is done with
an independent online analytical tool. Additionally, case study of an actual port is provided to illustrate and alidate our method.

This paper proposes a method of symbolic analysis by taking into account the size of symbolic signal changes. Symbols are
divided into two groups: that for the increasing signal and decreasing one. To store the signal amplitude information, three groups
of divisions are proposed i.c., amplitude less than one times standard deviation, that is more than or equal to one times standard
deviation to less than two times standard deviation and more than two times standard deviation. The probability of each symbol
in a series of data is calculated. Besides, Shannon entropy of all the data on each sample was also calculated. The result suggests
that the probability of each symbol has a significant difference between the normal subject and patients with congestive heart

In today???s business, it is almost impossible for any organization to close their eyes to the use of Information Technology (IT). The
utilization of IT is usually given in a form of services called IT services which generally delivered not only for specific unit but for
the whole organization. Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS) is an academic institution which currently has 89 units. Even
though IT services are provided and maintained by the ICT Directorate, IT local in each unit can use his discretion to develop his
own IT initiatives. Ideally, the IT local should respond to any incident occurred in his unit before he escalates the incident to the
directorate. Nevertheless, in most cases, IT locals pass through their own checking process while in fact, some incidents were
originated from units. Thus, the ICT Directorate realizes the need to explore incidents that usually occurred in units and propose a
solution to handle similar incidents happened in the future. This paper presents the work to identify major incidents which
frequently occurred in units and from which propose Work Instructions (WI). The identification of incidents was conducted using
Root-Causes Analysis while the categorization of major incidents was performed using Failure Modes, Effects and Critically

The main problem of the electrical operational systems in Indonesia is how to maintain the continuity of effective and efficient
services to the customers and meet the supply and demand for electrical power, particularly a lot of islands area in Indonesia are
far distant from the power generation sources. Based on these problems, it is cleared that an electricity system is required for long-
term solutions so that it can enhance the role of new and renewable energy, improve the electricity reliability and reduce the energy
costs. Efficiency and effectiveness is expected to increase the sustainable electricity supply for remote and isolated area in Madura
island by utilizing the available resources like potential solar energy as a new and renewable energy. The development of
photovoltaic power plant is a fast and independent solution because the access and infrastructure in Madura island doesn???t support
yet for the conventional electrical facilities. System dynamics method is used to analyse the system by creating a scenario model
to identify any factors and variables which affect the system. As the result of the scenario model, total demand for electricity supply
in the 58 remote villages in Pamekasan is 24,935 MW, which cost Rp 632.812.500.000,- for the photovoltaic power plant
investment. To complete the analysis feasibility in order to meet the fulfilment, it is also considered economics aspect with Payback

Malaysian Government began to introduce HIS in 1999 to cover both clinical and non-clinical information systems. Since then
hospitals have been facing challenges to achieve the objectives of its introduction. Thus, it is important to understand
determinants for successful implementation in order to ensure sustainable HIS. Various determinants render successful
implementation, such as human factors, technology factors as well as organizational factors. However, understanding
organizational factors becomes important, since the systems runs within the organization itself. The other two factors; human and
technology factors have been discussed elsewhere by the authors. Any issues pertaining to the organization if identified earlier
will prevent implementation failure. Hence, this paper aims to provide a review of barriers associated with organization factors
hindering the sustainability of HIS, and propose strategies required to minimize the issues discussed. Based on our review, this
paper highlighted four main challenges from an organization perspective; high adoption cost, top management support, adequate
infrastructure and security and privacy issues.

critical due to frequent changes among IT team members. It is the nature of this organization to send their staffs to foreign
countries for several years. Then they are back to home country for another couple of years, and get ready for their next
assignments abroad. A fundamental step in a software development standard procedure is determining the most suitable software
development method. However, there was lack of investigation for this selection. To address this problem, a study using Analytic
Hierarchy Process (AHP) is conducted. The factor variables are personnel, requirements, applications, organizations, businesses,

collecting data using different questionnaire assessments for each perspective. Then the questionnaire results served as inputs for
understanding the relationships between factors on the conceptual model by applying the partial least square (PLS) technique using
SmartPLS software. This study results in factors that are perceived well by students and academic staffs. Students understands that
service quality is the most important factor while academic staffs understands that technology transfer factor is important for the

The detailed basemap of Madiun City, known as RDTR and RTRW has been developed in 2016 and approved by
Indonesian Geospatial Information Agency (BIG). This detailed and accurate digital map is supposed to be used by
Madiun City Development Planning Agency (Bappeda) and other units in Madiun City Government as their reference
map. Several digital maps are being developed on top of this reference map, including the Madiun City Asset map
which record all buildings and land areas owned by the Madiun City Government. To improve the usability and
functionality of this asset map, an asset management system, based on WebGIS is proposed. In this WebGIS, city
assets of land and buildings are coded and organized in a web-based application for a better management, and it can
be accessed by public easily and quickly. The system development method is the Waterfall. ArcGIS Map is used as
an online map platform for the visualization map of land and building asset in Madiun City. The current asset map
contains more than 400 asset data with 17 categories. This WebGIS asset management system supports the smart
governance in Madiun City toward the development of Madiun Smartcity.
